# Flower Pollination Algorithm Implementation
Flower pollination algorithm is a metaheuristic algorithm that was developed by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xin-She_Yang] (Xin-She Yang), based on the pollination process of flowering plants.

This algorithm has 4 rules or assumptions:
1. Biotic and cross-pollination is considered as a global pollination process with pollen carrying pollinators performing Levy flights.
2. Abiotic and self-pollination are considered as local pollination.
3. Flower constancy can be considered as the reproduction probability is proportional to the similarity of two flowers involved.
4. Local and global pollination are controlled by a switch probability {\displaystyle p\in [0,1]} {\displaystyle p\in [0,1]}. Due to the physical proximity and other factors such as wind, local pollination can have a significant fraction q in the overall pollination activities.
